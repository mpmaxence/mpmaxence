# What we do 
### Our business wants to modify the way people consume art and culture. 

Our project is to create a platform that allows users to order live shows "spectacles vivants": theatre, opera, shows, festivals, concerts, “cinema d’auteur” thanks to a subscription that makes a price per seat very much cheaper thanks to partnerships with cultural institutions... 

The platform looks like a Netflix one, based on subscription by every people who wants to go and see several shows every month in his/ her town. 

### The subscription wants to be affordable and flexible.

### The offer is personalized and original.

The idea is starting to be experimented in Lille which benefits from a very dynamic cultural life. Next step : development in Paris, European Capitals and other towns (France, England, Spain, Germany…) 
 
## Mission. 
To modify the way people consume live shows and digitalize it. 
 
## Description of Product and Service. 
A platform which gives free information of what happen in terms of culture and shows in your town but where you have to pay to book places by a subscription.

Algorithm for a personalized offer depending on what you like / have seen before 

Negotiation of contracts with cultural partners to have a quota of places in every show for the users of the platform (App + website) 

 
## Value proposition to Customer

- Pay less for live shows (that are quite expensive)

- Cultural partners sell all their tickets, and before but for a little bit less expensive - All the info + booking on one only platform 
 
## Innovative dimensions of the product or service.
- Modification of how people consume culture
- democratize culture 
- find a younger public 
 
## Target market(s).
- BtoB between cultural partners and our platform (Comités d’entreprises, agents touristiques, partenaires publics).  
- BtoC : medium (from 1 show seen by month) and big consumers of shows and culture from 20 to 50 years old
